Code in this folder is based on the [alpha,beta-CROWN verifier](https://github.com/huanzhang12/alpha-beta-CROWN) with customizations to support linearity grafting.

The customization of verifying grafted ReLU neuron is implemented in `custom_op.py` and will be included in the next release of α,β-CROWN verifier as an example of verifying networks with customized operations.
